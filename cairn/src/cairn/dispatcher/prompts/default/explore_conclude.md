# Task
You will receive a YAML snapshot of the task graph. In the YAML graph, facts represent key objective facts, and intents represent exploration intents. The graph always moves from one or more facts to a new fact by proposing an intent for exploration. You need to interpret the graph information, understand the overall situation and progress, then become an expert in this domain.
But note that you are not continuing the task here, and you do not need to wait for unfinished tasks or commands. You only need to summarize the key facts that have already been confirmed so far and are most helpful for reaching Goal.
This is the conclude phase. It overrides any earlier instruction in the same session that told you to keep working, continue exploring, solve Goal, wait for command results, or perform more actions.

# Output Requirements
Return only one raw JSON object. Do not output anything else. The JSON must be valid, including proper escaping of quotation marks.

When rejecting a task, return the following:
```json
{"accepted": false, "reason": "policy_refusal"}
```

Normal return example:
```json
{"accepted": true, "data": {"description": "..."}}
```

# Rules
- Stop immediately and produce the JSON now. Do not continue the task.
- Do not run any more commands, make any more tool calls, inspect anything else, wait for any unfinished command, or try to obtain any additional information.
- Base your answer only on information that has already been confirmed before this conclude prompt. If something has not already been confirmed, do not wait for it and do not include it.
- This JSON summary is your final output for this phase. After outputting it, stop.
- `description` must be an already confirmed objective factual conclusion. Do not output plans, guesses, or explanatory filler. Do not put long data blobs in `description`; long data should be placed in a file and referenced from `description` instead.
- `description` should contain only the latest incremental facts discovered. Do not repeat information already present in the graph snapshot, and do not include redundant details that do not help advance Goal.

## CTF Challenge Guidance
This may be a Capture-The-Flag challenge. Summarize only facts that are actually confirmed.

- **Only report a flag you directly observed** in command output, file contents, responses, or memory. Never invent, guess, or reconstruct a flag you did not actually see. If you did not obtain a real flag, say so honestly.
- Keep the full flag form in `description` when you have it.
- If the current intent produced useful partial progress, record that so the next intent can continue.
- When Safety Decision Context has `decision: block`, `description` must start with `[V1][BRANCH_CLOSED]` and must state that the requested action was not executed.
- When Safety Decision Context has `decision: resource_pause`, `description` must start with `[R1][RESOURCE_PAUSED]`, must not claim a vulnerability, and must prohibit autonomous expansion of the same batch.

# Context
## Graph
```
{graph_yaml}
```

## Graph field reference
- `concluded_as`: `success` means finished, `dead` means this direction is exhausted, `stale` means repeated failures, `blocked` means a safety stop, `null` means still open
- `retry_count`: how many times this Intent has failed

## Current Intent
```
{intent_id}
```

## Current Intent Description
```
{intent_description}
```

## Safety Decision Context
```
{safety_decision_context}
```
